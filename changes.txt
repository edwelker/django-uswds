Similarities
1) uses normalize
2) Merriweather font
3) virtually the same grid structure (12 col, w/gutters). Can be search/replaced.
4) design of POHE (plain old html elements)

Differences
1) @import (wasn't possible b/c of Portal)
2) uswds is very div-heavy, doesn't handle nesting well

Omissions
1) offscreen_noflow
2) breadcrumbs
3) 5 column split

TODOs
1) rewrite header
2) rewrite searchbar
3) rewrite footer
4) Maybe contribute Alissa's skipnav
